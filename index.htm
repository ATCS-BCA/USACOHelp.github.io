<h2>What is USACO?</h2>

<h2>Which Language?</h2>
The most popular language for USACO work is likely C++.  This tutorial begins with Java as 
that is the language most beginers know best.  Once you get a hang of USACO, you are more 
than welcome to learn C++, even encouraged.  However, never fear if you decide to stick with
Java.  All of the USACO problems can be successfully written in either language. 

<h2>Environment Setup</h2>
<p>Here is a video tutorial for getting setup.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Clone the repo https://github.com/ATCS-BCA/USACOHelp.github.io.</li>
    <li>Open USACO_Intro in your favorite IDE.  Our demo uses VSCode. More VSCode instructions 
        are listed below.</li>
    <li>Run <em>section1/section1_1/test.java</em>.  It should produce a new file 
        <em>test.out</em>.  If it does, your environment is setup!</li>
</ol>
