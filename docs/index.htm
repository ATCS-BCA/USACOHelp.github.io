<h2>What is USACO?</h2>

<h2>Which Language?</h2>
The most popular language for USACO work is likely C++.  This tutorial begins with Java as 
that is the language most beginers know best.  Once you get a hang of USACO, you are more 
than welcome to learn C++, even encouraged.  However, never fear if you decide to stick with
Java.  All of the USACO problems can be successfully written in either language. 



<h2>Environment Setup</h2>
<p>You can follow the text below to setup your environment.  This <a href="http://youtu.be/XHWw6VngnTo?hd=1">video</a>
    also walks you through the process.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Clone the repo <a href="https://github.com/ATCS-BCA/USACOHelp.github.io">https://github.com/ATCS-BCA/USACOHelp.github.io</a>.</li>
    <li>Open USACO_Intro in your favorite IDE.  Our demo uses VSCode. More VSCode instructions 
        are listed below.</li>
    <li>Run <em>section1/section1_1/test.java</em>.  It should produce a new file 
        <em>test.out</em>.  If it does, your environment is setup!</li>
</ol>

<!-- VSCode Configuration -->
<h3>VSCode</h3>
<h4>Why VS Code</h4>
<p>One of the challenges of USACO is that they do not use packages.  Organization of folders in Eclipse and IntelliJ often involves
packages.  In VSCode, new folders do not necessasarilly mean new packages.</p>
<h4>General VSCode Setup</h4>
<p>After installing VSCode, you may wish to install the following extensions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Java Extension Pack</li>
    <li>Code Runner</li>
    <li>Java Code Generators</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h4>Getting Setup</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Open the Folder <em>USACO_Intro</em></li>
    <li>File->Save Workspace As -- choose a name of your preference for saving the workspace.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Running Programs</h4>
<p>In our setup the input data files are commingled in the source directories.  This helps in organization.
    However, to run the Java programs, you will need to navigate to the source directory.  
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Launch the terminal.</li>
    <li>Change directories to <em>section1/section1_1</em> </li>
    <li>Run <em>javac *.java</em> to compile source in this directory. </li>
    <li>Run <em>java test</em> to execute test. </li>
</ul>
